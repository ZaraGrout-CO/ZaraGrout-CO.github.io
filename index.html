    <p>Companion planting is an organic gardening method to enhance growing results by placing mutually beneficial plants next
        to each other. This can aid in deterring or distracting pests, disease or larger animals, helping with pollination,
    or complimenting soil chemistry. Pot marigolds or calendula are a useful companion plant for vegetables in the garden, 
    particularly french or runner beans. They attract aphids away, as well as encouraging aphid predators such as ladybirds
     or hoverflies. They also attract beneficial pollinators, including: </p>
